            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p class="p-below-title">
                Joining the University Mario Kart League is a commitment to the future of Mario Kart esports in the United Kingdom, 
                and we would love to have your university represented in the league. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The UMKL presents an exciting opportunity for students across the country to make connections 
                and have fun alongside their studies, while also providing a look into the growing competitive scene of Mario Kart.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being a part of the UMKL is a responsibility. 
                University teams are expected to maintain a level of activity throughout the season, 
                as with many teams comes a greater weight on scheduling. 
            </p>

            <p >
                Teams are also expected to act respectfully 
                and dignified to both their opponents and their peers, and we reserve the right to pull a team from the 
                league if they are acting in problematic manner.
            </p>
                
            <h3>Joining the UMKL</h3>
            <p class="p-below-title">
                For societies and teams wanting to enter their university, please ensure that you are in a position 
                to do so and that a team representing your university doesn't currently exist. Teams should first check 
                if their university has enough players interested and should seek to organise 6v6 test matches against 
                other universities to gage interest. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The best way to do this is to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/6jS7YUqnbh">Discord Server</a> 
                and talk to other teams. Please note that current students, alumni students, university faculty and 
                prospective students (holding an offer) are welcome to compete for your team, but players outside of 
                your university may not be allowed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Teams should thoroughly brief themselves on the <a href="pages/rules/">rules of the league</a> and relay this information to 
                their players before forming a team. The majority of our UMKL matches are livestreamed and recorded 
                for entertainment and promotion, and teams should also make their players aware of this. Players should
                be briefed on this fact and be told about the consequences of misconduct should it occur on our live matches.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Once teams have completed the above requirements, they should contact the UMKL board with 
                their request to join and we will review it. This is best done on the <a href="https://discord.gg/6jS7YUqnbh">UMKL discord server</a>.
                If accepted, your team will be inducted into the following season of the league. A season will 
                typically begin in October, and end in April, with us taking a break over the Winter period.
            </p>

            <p>
                If accepted, the board will ask your team to nominate two individuals to join 
                the UMKL board, so you can best represent your team and its interests.
            </p>
                
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="p-below-title">
                We hope that everything here is clear, and we look forward to seeing your team 
                joining the UMKL and competing in the next season. For any questions, queries or inquiries 
                contact any of the UMKL board and we would be more than happy to help!
            </p>
