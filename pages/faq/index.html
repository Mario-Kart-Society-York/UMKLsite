        <h4>I've just joined the server, but I can't use any commands,
            nor see my own team's channels?</h4>
        <p class="p-no-spacing">
            Use <code>/register</code> to register your user with the bot
            (you can use commands in any channel). After that you can use other commands,
            like <code>/join</code> to register your account on your university's team.

        <h4>Why can't I see my team's channel? What should I do?</h4>
        <p class="p-no-spacing">
            Members of your team need to use the <code>/join</code> command
            to join, this will give them the correct role and allow them to view their team's channel.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h4>I joined the wrong team! What should I do?</h4>
        <p class="p-no-spacing">
            Please contact a member of the board and they will place you in the right team.

        <h4>What should I do before a match starts?</h4>
        <p class="p-no-spacing">
            <mention>@Cheep Cheep</mention> will send a button to your respective team's channel.
            Here, the six members of the university team who are playing the match should
            click the "join" button and enter the requested information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The display name they're going to use on their Switch <b>(required)</b></li>

        <h4>A member on my team doesn't have a Discord account? What do I do about them?</h4>
        <p class="p-no-spacing">
            Please ask them to create an account and join the server:

        </p>
        <p>
            A Discord account is needed for <mention>@Cheep Cheep</mention> and the database to function,
            as well as setting up matches, so please ask all members of your team to join the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/6jS7YUqnbh">UMKL Discord Server</a>.

        <h4>What does the create team command do? Who can join a team?</h4>
        <p class="p-no-spacing">
            If your team is new you will need to create your team for it to be added to
            the database.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>team_name</b>: the name of your team, pick something simple and easy for this (like
                <code>York</code>)
            </li>
            <li><b>institution_name</b>: the formal name for your university (like <code>University of York</code>)</li>
            <li><b>team_color</b>: the colour your team receives in scoring graphics and your
                team's discord role. This is entered as a hex colour code (see the below question).
                For example: <code>#1BAA8B</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Anyone in the corresponding university can join their team. Before a match, a "team signup"
            process is conducted, where the six players who are going to play in the match join.

                A hex colour code is 6 (hexadecimal) characters that represent a single colour. You can use the colour
                picker below or a access a hex colour picker here: <br><a target="_blank"

            </div>

            <p>
                Please note that Discord doesn't accept <code>#000000</code> (completely black) or <code>#FFFFFF</code>
                (completely white) as a hex code. Your team colour is the role colour your team will receive on Discord, 
                so consider colour contrast with dark and light modes when picking.

            No. Shut up. Stop it. Well you know how our decimal system has 10 possible numbers (0-9), this is called a
            base-10
            numbering system. Hexadecimal (hex) is a base-16 numbering system, meaning its possible values are from 0-9
            and
            A-F (A-F essentially representing 10-15).
        </p>
        <p>
            Software developers and system designers widely use hexadecimal numbers because they provide a convenient
            representation
            of binary-coded values. Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble.
            For example,
            an 8-bit byte is two hexadecimal digits and its value can be written as <code>00</code> to <code>FF</code>
            in hexadecimal.
            <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">[I stole this paragraph from Wikipedia – The Free
                    Encyclopedia]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            A hex code is split into three parts, Let's say we have the hex colour code <code>#1BAA8B</code>.
            Ignore the # and split the string into three parts of two.
        </p>
        <p>
            We get <code>1B</code>, <code>AA</code> and <code>8B</code>. Since these are hexadecimal values, this means
            that two hexadecimal numbers cover 162 values,
            so 0-255 as denary. If we convert each group into denary, we get <code>27</code>, <code>170</code> and
            <code>139</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of these numbers we got represent the <code>RGB</code> values of a colour - red, green and blue. AKA
            <code>RGB(27, 170, 139)</code>. This is another colour format also used,
            so essentially, a hex colour code is a compact version of RGB.
