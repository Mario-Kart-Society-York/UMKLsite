        <p class="below-title">Frequently asked questions concerning about the Discord server and bot.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>I've just joined the server, but I can't use any commands, 
            nor see my own team's channels?</h4>
        <p class="below-title">
            Use <code>/register</code> to register your user with the bot 
            (you can use commands in any channel). After that you can use other commands, 
            like <code>/join</code> to register your account on your university's team.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Why can't I see my team's channel? What should I do?</h4>
        <p class="below-title">
            Members of your team should use the <code>/join</code> command 
            to join. Please note that you have to use <code>/register</code> and register 
            your user with the bot before using <code>/join</code>.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>I joined the wrong team! What should I do?</h4>
        <p class="below-title">
            Please contact a member of the board and they will place you in the right team.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>What should I do before a match starts?</h4>
        <p class="below-title">
            The Cheep Cheep Bot will send a button to your respective team's channel. 
            Here, the six members of the university team who are playing the match should 
            click the "join" button and enter the requested information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The display name they're going to use on their Switch <b>(required)</b></li>
            <li>Their Switch friend code <b>(optional)</b></li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>A member on my team doesn't have a Discord account? What do I do about them?</h4>
        <p class="below-title">
            Please ask them to create an account and join the server: 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/6jS7YUqnbh">https://discord.gg/6jS7YUqnbh</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A Discord account is needed for the Cheep Cheep bot and the database to function, 
            as well as setting up matches, so please ask all members of your team to join the 
            <a href="https://discord.gg/6jS7YUqnbh">UMKL Discord Server</a>.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>What does the create team command do? Who can join a team?</h4>
        <p class="below-title">
            If your team is new you will need to create your team for it to be added to
            the database.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>team_name</b>: the name of your team, pick something simple and easy for this (like <code>York</code>)</li>
            <li><b>institution_name</b>: the formal name for your university (like <code>University of York</code>)</li>
            <li><b>team_color</b>: the colour your team receives in scoring graphics and your 
                team's discord role. This is entered as a hex colour code (see the below question). 
                For example: <code>#1BAA8B</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Anyone in the corresponding uni can join their team. Before a match, a "team signup" 
            process is conducted, where the six players who are going to play in the match join.
        </p>

        <h4>Why is there a <img src="assets/logo/questionmark.webp" alt=""> on my team's profile?</h4>
        <p class="below-title">
            In addition to the above commands, each team should have a logo. Please submit a logo to a member of the 
            board to have it added to your team's profile.
        </p>

        <h4>What is a hex colour code?</h4>
        <p class="below-title">
            A hex colour code is 6 (hexadecimal) characters that represent a colour. You can 
            access a hex colour picker here: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hex+colour+picker">hex colour picker | google</a>. 
        </p>
        <img src="assets/image/faq/googlecolorpicker.png" alt="A screenshot of the Google colour picker">
        <img src="assets/image/faq/discordrole.gif" alt="A gif of the Discord role colour screen, switching through colours on the rainbow">
        <p>
            Please note that Discord doesn't accept <code>#000000</code> (complete black) or <code>#FFFFFF</code> (complete white) 
            as a hex code. Your team colour is the role colour your team will receive on Discord, so 
            consider colour contrast with dark and light mode when picking.
        </p>

        <h4>What the hell is a "hex"? Like… the "Lost Hex" from Sonic Lost World?</h4>
        <br/><img class="image" src="assets/image/faq/losthex.png" alt="">
        <p>
            No. Shut up. Stop it. Well you know how our decimal system has 10 possible numbers (0-9), this is called a base-10 
            numbering system. Hexadecimal (hex) is a base-16 numbering system, meaning its possible values are from 0-9 and 
            A-F (A-F essentially representing 10-15).
        </p>
        <p>
            Software developers and system designers widely use hexadecimal numbers because they provide a convenient representation 
            of binary-coded values. Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble. For example, 
            an 8-bit byte is two hexadecimal digits and its value can be written as <code>00</code> to <code>FF</code> in hexadecimal. [I stole this paragraph 
            from Wikipedia – The Free Encyclopedia]
        </p>
        <p>
            A hex code is split into three parts, Let's say we have the hex colour code <code>#1BAA8B</code>. 
            Ignore the # and split the string into three parts of two.
        </p>
        <p>
            We get <code>1B</code>, <code>AA</code> and <code>8B</code>. Since these are hexadecimal values, this means that two hexadecimal numbers cover 162 values, 
            so 0-255 as denary. If we convert each group into denary, we get <code>27</code>, <code>170</code> and <code>139</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of these numbers we got represent the <code>RGB</code> values of a colour - red, green and blue. AKA <code>RGB(27, 170, 139)</code>. This is another colour format also used, 
            so essentially, a hex colour code is a compact version of RGB.
